/* Tokenizing a string with stringstreams

  One thing stringstreams are used for is for splitting a string
  into chunks ("tokenizing").

  Given a string, you can create a stringstream from it, then
  use the stream extraction operator to extract pieces of it. This
  can also extract the pieces as particular data types (int, string) just
  like reading from a file.

  To create a stringstream from a string, just pass the string to the constructor
  of the stringstream

  std::string str = "Word 20 3.1415";
  std::stringstream ss(str);
  
  /*
  Extract the word as a string, the integer as an int,
  and the floating point decimal as a double
  Remember to include the proper header!

  int i;
  double d;

  ss >> word;
  ss >> i;
